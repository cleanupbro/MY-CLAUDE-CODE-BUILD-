# STATUS: Clean Up Bros
*Last Sync: January 21, 2026*

## ACTIVE FOCUS
- **Current Task**: Phase 2 - Supabase database integration
- **Working In**: Ready for new session
- **Blockers**: None

## SESSION CONTEXT
- **Phase**: Production (Sealed Universe Protocol complete)
- **Tech Stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase + Stripe
- **Recent Change**: Implemented Sealed Universe Protocol, consolidated workspace

## WHAT WAS DONE LAST SESSION
1. Implemented Sealed Universe Protocol (STATUS.md, PLAN.md, LOG.md)
2. Updated CLAUDE.md & GEMINI.md with skills references
3. Created docs/skills/ with done-for-day, deploy, bug-fix skills
4. Consolidated all business assets to docs/media/
5. Cleaned root directory from 19 to 14 items
6. Created README.md with full project documentation
7. Tested build (passing) and frontend (working)

## CRITICAL RULES
1. **Boundaries**: This folder is a sealed universe. No outside dependencies.
2. **Structure**: Product code lives in `src/`. Documentation in `docs/`.
3. **Memory**: Never trust chat history. Read this file first.
