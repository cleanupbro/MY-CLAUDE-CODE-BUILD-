# PART 2: BUSINESS STRATEGY

## 2.1 Revenue Priority Stack

```
1. DEEP CLEANS        → Flagship upsell, gateway to recurring clients
2. AIRBNB/SHORT-STAY  → High-volume recurring, property manager contracts
3. COMMERCIAL         → Growth segment, contract-based recurring revenue
4. GENERAL CLEANING   → Recurring maintenance (flows from deep cleans)
5. BOND/END-OF-LEASE  → Reactive, referral-based, seasonal peaks
```

---

## 2.2 The Deep Clean Funnel

```
NEW CLIENT INQUIRY
       ↓
   DEEP CLEAN (one-off reset)
       ↓
   WEEKLY/FORTNIGHTLY GENERAL CLEAN (recurring revenue)
       ↓
   SEASONAL DEEP CLEAN (quarterly/biannual reset)
       ↓
   LOYAL CLIENT + REFERRALS
```

**Key Insight:** Deep clean is the "reset" that makes weekly maintenance faster, easier, and cheaper. It's the gateway to recurring revenue.

---

## 2.3 Target Client Profiles

### Primary Targets

**Airbnb/Short-Stay Hosts**
- Individual hosts with 1-5 properties
- Property managers with portfolios

**Commercial Clients**

- Medical/dental clinics
- Retail shops
- Childcare centres
- Gyms/fitness studios

- Families with young children
- People who haven't cleaned professionally in 6+ months
- Want: Reset their home, then maintain it
- Pain: Overwhelmed, don't know where to start

# PART 3: SERVICE DEFINITIONS

## 3.1 The Four Cleaning Missions

| Service | Mission | Objective |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **General Clean** | Maintenance | Keep a reasonably clean home tidy and hygienic |
| **Deep Clean** | Restoration | Reset the home to near-new condition |
| **End-of-Lease** | Compliance | Pass real estate inspection, get bond back |
| **Airbnb Turnover** | Guest-Ready | Fast, reliable, 5-star standard between guests |

**Simple version:**
- General clean = **maintain**
- Deep clean = **reset**
- End-of-lease / bond back = **pass inspection**
- Airbnb turnover = **guest-ready**

One keeps things nice. One fixes neglect. One protects your money. One protects your reviews.

---

## 3.2 General Clean (Maintenance)

### Purpose
Keep a reasonably clean home tidy and hygienic. For homes that are already in decent shape and cleaned regularly.

### Scope
- Surfaces wiped (not scrubbed)
- Floors vacuumed and mopped
- Bathrooms and kitchens cleaned to everyday standard
- Bins emptied
- General tidying

### Exclusions
- No heavy scrubbing
- No moving furniture
- No attacking long-term buildup
- No inside appliances
- No detailed grout work

### Ideal For
- Clients with ongoing weekly/fortnightly bookings
- Homes already maintained to reasonable standard
- Time-poor professionals who want to maintain, not restore

---

## 3.3 Deep Clean (Restoration) ⭐ FLAGSHIP SERVICE

### Purpose
Reset the home to near-new condition. A one-off intensive clean that goes far beyond regular cleaning — targeting built-up grime, hidden dust, and neglected areas.

### The Deep Clean Difference
```
A regular clean MAINTAINS cleanliness.
A deep clean RESTORES it.
```

### Scope — Everything in General Clean, PLUS:

**All Rooms:**
- Surfaces SCRUBBED rather than wiped
- Dust removed from skirting boards, door frames, window sills, light switches, power points, vents
- Cobwebs cleared
- Furniture wiped down
- Light furniture moved to clean underneath and behind (where safe/possible)
- Floors vacuumed and mopped thoroughly, edges included

**Kitchen:**
- Appliances cleaned externally (internally if requested — add-on)
- Benchtops, splashbacks, cupboard doors, handles, kickboards DEGREASED
- Sink descaled and polished
- Stovetops scrubbed to remove baked-on residue
- Built-up grease and food residue properly treated (not masked)

**Bathroom:**
- Tiles and grout SCRUBBED
- Shower screens DESCALED
- Toilets deep sanitised
- Sinks, taps, mirrors, fittings polished
- Soap scum, mould residue, hard-water marks TREATED
- Cabinets and storage fronts wiped down

**Bedrooms & Living Areas:**
- Beds, tables, chairs, visible furniture cleaned thoroughly
- Skirting boards and corners get detailed attention
- Dust removed from behind and under furniture (where accessible)

**Windows (Internal):**
- Internal glass and frames cleaned
- Tracks and sills wiped and detailed (if included in booking)

### Ideal For
- Properties not professionally cleaned in a while
- Preparing for guests or inspection
- STARTING ongoing regular cleaning (deep clean first, then maintain)
- Anyone wanting a noticeably higher standard than maintenance cleaning

### Upsell Path
**"Deep Clean Plus"** (+$50–80):
- Inside fridge
- Inside oven
- Heavy grout or mould treatment

### Sales Psychology
Position as a "reset clean" — clients accept the higher price once they understand it reduces future costs and makes ongoing cleans faster.

---

## 3.4 End-of-Lease / Bond Back Clean (Compliance)

### Purpose
Meet real estate and property manager standards. Pass inspection and get the bond back. This is NOT about comfort — it's about compliance.

### Scope — Checklist-Driven, Inspection-Focused

**Everything cleaned to inspection level:**
- Inside cupboards
- Inside oven
- Internal windows (glass, frames, tracks, sills)
- Skirting boards
- Walls spot-cleaned
- Bathrooms fully descaled
- Floors detailed
- Light fittings (dead insects removed)
- Exhaust fans
- Rangehood and filters

**The goal is simple:** Pass inspection and get the bond back.

### Key Differentiator from Deep Clean
- Follows a **checklist**, not personal preference
- Includes more areas (inside cupboards, inside oven, walls)
- Designed for **agent scrutiny**, not homeowner satisfaction
- Higher liability = higher price

### Bond Back Guarantee (72-Hour Window)
```
Clean Up Bros offers a 100% Bond Back Guarantee.

If your real estate agent identifies any cleaning issues within 72 HOURS 
of service completion, forward the Agent's Condition Report and photos 
to us. We will return to rectify issues that fall within our original 
scope of works at no additional charge.

Claims made after 72 hours will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
```

**Why 72 Hours (Not 24):**
- Real estate agents typically take 2–3 business days to inspect
- 24-hour windows may be deemed "Unfair Contract Terms" under Australian Consumer Law (ACL)
- 72 hours is industry standard and legally defensible

---

## 3.5 Airbnb / Short-Stay Turnover (Guest-Ready)

### Purpose
Fast, reliable, 5-star standard. Zero problems. Get the property guest-ready between bookings.

### Scope

**Standard Turnover:**
- All surfaces wiped and sanitised
- Floors vacuumed and mopped

- Bathroom cleaned (toilet, shower, basin, mirrors)
- Bins emptied, liners replaced

**Host Ready Plus** (+$25–40):
- Restocking checks (toiletries, supplies)
- Spot wall marks removed
- Extra bathroom detailing
- Linen change coordination
- Welcome setup (if specified)

### What Airbnb Clients Want
- **Consistency** — Same standard every time
- **Reliability** — Show up when scheduled, no excuses
- **Zero Problems** — Don't create issues for them to fix
- **5-Star Reviews** — Cleanliness is #1 driver of guest ratings

### Contract Structure

### Ideal For
- Individual hosts (1-5 properties)
- Property managers with portfolios
- Serviced apartments
- Holiday rentals

---

## 3.6 Commercial Cleaning (Contract-Based)

### Purpose
Predictable, consistent, contract-based cleaning for business premises. Clients think in monthly cost, not per-visit.

### Target Premises
- Small offices (under 500 sqm)
- Medical/dental clinics
- Retail shops
- Childcare centres
- Gyms/fitness studios
- Strata common areas

### Scope Options

**Standard Office Clean:**

- High-touch surfaces disinfected

**Premium Services (Add-ons):**
- Daytime cleans
- High-touch disinfection protocols
- Washroom consumables management
- Window cleaning
- Carpet shampooing
- After-hours availability

### Pricing Model
Quote as **monthly package** — sounds better and more professional.

Example: "$980 per month for 3x weekly service" beats "$75 per visit"

### What Commercial Clients Want
- **Predictable monthly cost**
- **After-hours availability** (or minimal disruption)
- **Compliance** (especially medical, childcare)
- **Accountability** — someone to call if something's wrong

---

# PART 4: PRICING STRUCTURE

## 4.1 Pricing Philosophy

**Three Rules:**
1. **Anchor high, sell middle** — Show a premium tier so standard feels reasonable
2. **Explain labour, not hours** — Clients don't buy time, they buy outcomes
3. **Discount frequency, not effort** — Reward repeat business, never one-off chaos

**Psychology:**
- Charge too little → attract chaos
- Charge too much → phone goes quiet
- Sweet spot → clear value tiers where clients self-select

---

## 4.2 Residential — General Clean (Maintenance)

| Property | Price Range | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| 1 Bed / 1 Bath | $90–$110 | |
| 2 Bed / 1 Bath | $110–$130 | |
| 2 Bed / 2 Bath | $130–$150 | |
| 3 Bed / 2 Bath | $150–$180 | |

**Frequency Discount:** 5–10% off for weekly/fortnightly recurring

**Premium Upsell — "Detail Boost"** (+$30–40):
- Skirting boards
- Extra bathroom detailing
- Interior windows touched up
- Same visit, higher perceived value

---

## 4.3 Residential — Deep Clean (Reset) ⭐

| Property | Price Range | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| 1 Bed / 1 Bath | $180–$220 | |
| 2 Bed / 1 Bath | $220–$260 | |
| 2 Bed / 2 Bath | $260–$300 | |
| 3 Bed / 2 Bath | $300–$360 | |

**Positioning:** Explain as a "reset clean" — reduces future costs, makes maintenance easier

**Premium Upsell — "Deep Clean Plus"** (+$50–80):
- Inside fridge
- Inside oven
- Heavy grout or mould treatment

---

## 4.4 Residential — End-of-Lease / Bond Back

| Property | Price Range | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Studio / 1 Bed | $250–$320 | |
| 2 Bed / 1 Bath | $320–$380 | |
| 2 Bed / 2 Bath | $380–$450 | |
| 3 Bed / 2 Bath | $450–$550 | |

**Pricing Psychology:** The 72-hour re-clean guarantee justifies the price more than any discount.

**Add-Ons (Clearly Priced):**
| Add-On | Price |
|--------|-------|
| Oven (internal) | $60–$80 |
| Internal windows & tracks | $60–$120 |
| Carpet steam (per room) | $40–$60 |
| Balcony | $50–$80 |
| Garage | $80–$150 |

Transparency builds trust and reduces negotiation.

---

## 4.5 Airbnb / Short-Stay Turnover

| Property | Price Range | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Studio / 1 Bed | $110–$140 | |
| 2 Bed / 1 Bath | $140–$160 | |
| 2 Bed / 2 Bath | $160–$180 | |
| Townhouse / 3 Bed | $180–$220 | |

**Best Pricing Strategy:**
- Offer **fixed pricing per property** for ongoing hosts
- Owners love predictability more than discounts

**Premium Upsell — "Host Ready Plus"** (+$25–40):
- Restocking checks
- Spot wall marks
- Extra bathroom detailing
- Linen change coordination

**Avoid luxury language.** Airbnb clients want zero problems, not gold-plated cleaning.

|---------------|-------------|
| Standard | $45–$55/hr |

## 8.3 Deep Clean Upsell Script

**When client inquires about General Clean:**

```
"Just to check — when was the property last professionally cleaned?

If it's been more than a month or two, we usually recommend starting 
with a Deep Clean. It's a one-off reset that tackles built-up grime, 
soap scum, and the areas regular cleaning misses.

Once we've done the deep clean, your regular cleans become faster, 
easier, and more effective — and often cheaper because we're 
maintaining, not restoring.

Would you like me to quote both so you can compare?"
