## Clean Up Bros - Standard Operating Procedure

**Purpose:** Debug and resolve issues systematically

## Steps

1. **Understand the Bug**
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - When did it start?
   - Can it be reproduced?

2. **Check Logs**
   - Browser console
   - Terminal output
   - MEMORY.md errors

3. **Check History**
   - Has this happened before?
   - What was the fix?

4. **Reproduce**
   - Follow exact steps
   - Capture error

5. **Isolate Cause**
   - Check recent changes
   - Add debugging logs
   - Narrow down location

6. **Fix**
   - Minimal change
   - Don't refactor

7. **Verify**
   - Build passes
   - Bug is fixed
   - Nothing new broke

8. **Document**
   - Add to MEMORY.md errors
   - Add to lessons learned
